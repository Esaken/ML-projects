1. What are money market funds, MMFs?
Money market funds are a type of mutual funds that invests in highly liquid, short-term debt securities. These funds aim to provide investors with a safe place to invest easily accessible, cash-equivalent assets.

2. Common investments within money market funds include:
-Kenya governments’ Treasury bills
-Commercial paper
-Certificates of deposit, and repurchase agreements.
-Negotiated bank deposits


*** These funds are considered to be low risk and are often used by investors as a temporary holding place for funds that are not being invested elsewhere, offering slightly higher returns than a regular savings account without much additional risk.

3. Capital Market Authority gives out licenses to investment schemes.

   - Operate with transparency regarding their investments and returns.
    - Maintain liquidity to allow you to enter and exit the investment with ease

4. Key characteristics of MMFs
        Liquidity: MMFs offer easy access to your money, making them highly liquid investments.

        You can typically withdraw your funds within a short period, hence providing the convenience of quick cash whenever you need it.

        Low Risk: They are considered low-risk investments compared to stocks or mutual funds.

        Your money is usually invested in high-quality, short-term debt securities, which minimizes your exposure to market volatility.

        Interest: Returns from MMFs come in the form of interest, which can be declared daily or monthly.

        These funds aim to offer stable and possibly competitive interest rates to safeguard and grow your investment.

        Capital Preservation: If safety is your primary concern, MMFs aim to maintain your capital’s value.

        While no investment is risk-free, money market funds focus on preserving your initial investment amount, often making them more appealing than more volatile options.

5. How MMFs work in Kenya
        Portfolio composition: In Kenya, the portfolio of an MMF includes a mix of money market instruments such as treasury bills, commercial paper, and fixed deposits.

        These instruments form a diversified fund to mitigate risk and provide potential returns.

        Investment process: To invest in an MMF in Kenya, you often begin by selecting a fund with a performance history and risk level that suits your needs.

        You can start with a minimal entry requirement and have the flexibility to increase your investment over time.

        Remember, despite their focus on safety and liquidity, the returns on MMFs can vary, and it’s important to review the fund’s performance

6. Choosing the right fund
When selecting an MMF, it’s important to compare different funds based on:

        Historical performance: Look for consistency in returns over time.
        Fees: Lower fees can significantly affect net returns.
        Fund manager reputation: Choose managers with a solid track record.
        Liquidity and minimum investment period: Ensure these align with your liquidity needs.

7. Understanding fees and expenses
Management fees: These fees are necessary for the management of the unit trust that usually underlies the MMF

8. RISKS to MMFs
        Interest rate fluctuations: Changes in interest rates can affect the performance of money market funds. If rates decrease, so may your potential returns.

        Inflation risk: While money market funds are a low-risk investment, inflation can erode the purchasing power of your returns over time.

        Credit risk: There is always a degree of credit risk involved, as you’re relying on the issuer’s ability to pay back the debt. Default on payments could affect the fund’s value.

        Fees: Despite generally lower fees, always be aware of the management fees and any other associated costs, as they can impact your net returns.

9. Traditional Savings vs. MMFs
        In comparing traditional savings accounts with MMFs, the latter often offer higher returns.

        A traditional savings account at a bank may give you a sense of security and ease of access, but the interest earned is typically low (5-7%) before tax.

        In contrast, MMFs aim to provide higher yield, often outpacing the inflation rate, which means your money has the potential to grow more over time. Rates around 9 -13% after tax, as of May, 2024.

        Moreover, you’ll find that MMFs maintain a high level of liquidity, similar to your savings account, allowing you to access your funds when needed.
